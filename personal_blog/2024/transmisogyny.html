        <p>
            For the past few months I have been making the same mistake and have been
            getting upset at internet strangers on any discourse post about transmisogyny and
            how it relates to misandry. Every time I have read a post by a trans femme
            explaining how transmisogyny affects her, there will no-doubt be comments on
            how it is a phenmomenon rooted in misandry. This take is such a pet-peeve of
            mine that whenever I do read the comments, often against my own best
            interests, I will lose track of time and get rationally upset; my own
            experiences with transmisogyny have shaped my life as a trans woman, and have
            been constant reminders in how we are discriminated against in daily life,
            primarily by cis people.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will first define what I believe transmisogyny is not. I am by no means an
            expert on this topic, but rather I am just a trans woman trying to get through
            life day by day. However, through classes I have taken and readings I have
            done, I feel like I am able to define this form of oppression fairly clearly.
            Since I am talking about how this relates to my life, I will use the term
            "trans woman" when talking about the oppression, rather than "trans feminine
            people". Transmisogyny is a form of misogyny which places trans woman into the
            objectified views of a cis woman, while not affirming her gender as being a
            woman when convenient. In online discussion I often see cis people assume that
            transmisogyny is just transphobia where people view us as a man, and then the
            demonization that follows because of the atmosphere regarding men at the
            moment. This take assumes that trans women are upset at the fact we are seen
            as hostile because we are perceived as men. This assumption is incorrect at
            its core. If this were the case, then that means that if men were not seen as
            inherent predators, then trans women would not be discriminated against as
            much, since the base assumption that we are men would not be seen as a bad
            thing. However, this is directly contradictory to my own lived experiences as
            a trans woman.
        </p>
        <p>
            Transmisogyny rather is a phenmomenon where us trans women are seen as women
            when it is convenient, and then reduced to men when we become a nuisance. It
            is no secret that transphobia is prevalent within society. We all see the
            bills being passed and the headlines stating that yet another trans person has
            been beaten to death by a transphobic cis mob. It is scary to be a trans
            person, even in a socially liberal city, as we are the new "other" group which
            has been the target of right-wing fear mongering for the past decade. But
            there is a common line of thought among trans allys that transphobia is
            exclusively the domain of the TERF and right-winger. That all transphobia
            stems from the base belief that we are men. This is incorrect, and only serves
            as a means to reassure the ally that they cannot possibly be transphobic
            because they are "on the right side of history". In my experiences,
            transphobia comes from everyone, ally and bigot alike, it is just the form
            and tolerability which changes. Transmisogyny can come from any cis person
            (or trans person with internalised transphobia).
        </p>
        <p>
            When a trans woman speaks out and gets angry at her treatment, what is the
            response? Some people listen, internalise her frustrations, and try to change
            their behaviour. Some people ignore her, thinking that she is exaggerating her
            lived experiences. But the group which sees her anger, and then thinks of her
            testosterone puberty as the reason she is angry, are the transmisogynists.
            This group has reduced her to being a man just because she speaks out about
            her treatment. Now, some may think that this is a problem because men are seen
            as inherently angry people; that they are dangerous because they can lash out
            at any time. And although in modern discourse this is how men are seen, this
            is not what distressed the trans woman. What distresses her is that she
            learns that if she speaks out against mistreatment, her right to being seen as
            a woman is taken away; and now she needs to re-prove to the world she is
            indeed a woman. Even if the perspective against men was less severe, that they
            were not seen as predatory, the trans woman would still be upset. She would
            still be seen as a man. Whatever your take on the reality of misandry is, it
            should be clear that it is irrelevant to her concerns. Even if it was seen as
            "okay" to be a man, this form of transmisogyny would still exist: a trans
            woman would still lose the respect of the masses when she is being "uppity".
        </p>
        <p>
            A purity culture then forms: a trans woman is not allowed to be anything but
            what cis people want them to be. This is analagous to how women were seen
            before feminist movements changed the way that women were treated; a woman was
            only allowed to be what men want them to be. And this is what transmisogyny
            is. When a trans woman has her identity effectively revoked when she speaks
            out, when her experiences being seen as a sex object due to her being an
            exotic figure are ignored, when people tell her that the discrimination she
            faces is just because she is seen as a man; these all push her into the "male"
            box, and she learns not to rock the boat because all she wants is to be seen
            as a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems that when transphobic bills are put forward, such as the infamous
            "bathroom bills", cis allies will think that these are abhorrent. They
            understand that us trans women are in danger of being harassed, and they don't
            want us to be hurt. But a common joke is to post a picture of a passing trans
            man and say "do you want him in your bathroom?" Immediately they compare a
            trans woman to a man. They don't talk about the humiliation we feel going into
            the wrong bathroom. They don't talk about how we are likely to be hate crimed
            because we are nearly-passing and obviously faggy. They post a man to
            effectively say "trans women aren't nearly as manly as he is". This is a form
            of transmisogyny. It is an ally defending us by using the assumption of a TERF
            that we are men. Sure it uses their fear of men against them, and it can be
            argued that this is also perpetrating misandry. However, even though the
            two topics often come up in the same arguments, if the misandry didn't exist
            trans women would still be seen as dangerous because they are an "other". Was
            it misandry when cis lesbians were seen as predatory, and that they were
            threatened against going into women's bathrooms? Yes, I would say it was.
            Masculinity was seen as dangerous, and that is why they were harassed. I would
            say there is also misandry in the trans woman example. However, the trans
            misogyny that is different to the misandry is the reduction of a trans woman
            into a man to win an argument. We aren't seen as women in the ally's response
            because it is easier to reduce us to men when convenient; we are never truly
            seen as a woman by either party.

            I will end this article with an example of transmisogyny I faced in my life.
            As a content warning, it describes an experience when I was sexually
            assaulted.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was hanging out late one night with friends on a trip we took in a hostel
            lobby. We were talking and having a good time. I feel my friends all see me as
            a woman, and I was comfortable in my own skin. The friends consisted of a cis
            woman, a non-binary person, and a cis man. This stranger comes into the lobby
            and decides to join our conversation, which we all thought would be a good
            idea so we indulged. The stranger's first act was to go to the table me and my
            friends were sitting at, and proceed to guess our sexuality. She pointed at
            the cis woman and guessed "lesbian". She pointed to the enby and guessed
            "lesbian". She pointed as the cis man, and guessed "gay". She pointed at me,
            hesitated a moment, and guessed "trans".
        </p>
        <p>
            If we were to immediately analyse this first interaction, we can see that she
            viewed being transgender as being a sexuality; my first interaction with this
            woman was having my identity become a sex object to her. This should have been
            the first indicator she was a chaser looking to get some dick; in the process
            she now only sees me as a source of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            She continues to chat as we continue to chat. But she starts to sexually
            harass the cis man. Even though she thought he was gay, she was pressuring him
            to fuck her. This continues as me and my friends are uncomfortable, but we all
            were high and feeling unsafe so we didn't have the mental fortitude to stop
            it. Notably, the woman never approaches my friend. She keeps her distance,
            always stopping short of touching him. She only ever verbally harasses him, by
            explaining in detail her sexuality and how she feels she can convert gay men.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was feeling unsafe, but I was hoping that she would leave me alone. But this
            thought didn't last long when she snapped to me, started calling me beautiful
            and approaching me. I thought she would just verbally harass me, as she did my
            friend, but instead she immediately grabs the back of my head and forces me to
            look at her. Throughout the night, she would continue to assault me and harass
            my friend, stopping only when a friend of hers pulls her away from us.
        </p>
        <p>
            She felt like she had the right to my body, only because I am a trans woman.
            She didn't feel safe approaching the cis man, but because she saw me as
            something other than a man but not quite a woman she felt like she could
            approach me; she saw me as something she is allowed to fuck without
            repercussion. This immediate objectification of me came because she didn't see
            me as a woman; she never approached the people she viewed as women. She was
            not being misandirist; she respected the man's autonomy, even if it was for
            her own physical safety. But because she felt like I wouldn't fight back
            because I am a trans woman, she targeted me. If society's misandry didn't
            exist, would I have no been fetishised? Would she not have felt similarly
            safe violating me? I think if you believe this, you are just looking for a way
            to ignore trans women for your own cause.
        </p>
        <p>
            Men face their own discrimination in today's society. I think it is abohorrent
            how men are seen as inherently predatory; this belief affected me before I
            realised I was trans. I felt like I would be harassing any woman I talk to, so
            I avoided it completely. I was self hating when I thought I was a man, because
            I listened to women and didn't want to hurt them. But this is a completely
            separate topic to the issues I face as a trans woman. The feelings and effects
            are disjoint. I think we should be able to talk about both issues without
            minimising the minority who is actively at risk in the political atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wonder if it will be misandry when my right to transition and HRT is
            revoked, too.
