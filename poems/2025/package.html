            i wonder what it's like<br>
            to be a package<br>
            on a conveyer line
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            originally destined to go anywhere<br>
            but all possibilites allowed
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            does it hope that it will be<br>
            destined to go up<br>
            and be delivered by truck?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            does it hope that it will be<br>
            dropped below<br>
            and flown<br>
            free for a thousand miles?
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            does it get worried<br>
            as the other packages<br>
            get less frequent
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            and its paths reduced<br>
            until the only path left
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">
            does it hope that<br>
            the noise it hears<br>
            and the teeth it sees<br>
            isn't its doom?
        </p>
